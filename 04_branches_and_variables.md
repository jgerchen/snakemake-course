# 4. Branches and variables

In the previous part we saw how to build a simple two-rule system. However, our bioinformatics workflows usually involve more then two rules, which are not always connected in a linear way. In this part we'll get into how to organize our workflow into more complex patterns involving more variables, how to simplify how we specify our rules using variables and how to plot more complex workflows.
