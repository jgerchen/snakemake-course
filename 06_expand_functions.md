# 6. Expanding wildcards

In the previous part we already saw that a rule with a wildcard may be run multiple times if we ask Snakemake to create multiple output files with different values for that wildcard. In addition to that, a rule can also be run multiple times if a second rule will have several input files, which can be resolved with different values for that wildcard. Consider the following Scenario:


```
rule rule_1:
	output: "rule1_file{wc1}.txt"
	shell: "echo {wildcards.wc1} > {output}"

rule rule_2:
 	input: 
        "rule1_file1.txt",
        "rule1_file2.txt",
        "rule1_file3.txt"
	output: "rule2_cat.txt"
    shell: "cat {input} > {output}"
```

If we tell Snakemake to generate **rule2_cat.txt** Snakemake will run rule_1 three times, because each of the three input files can be generated by replacing the wildcard **{wc1}** with different values, either 1, 2 or 3.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that although it is **rule_1**, which is run three times, it is the input of **rule_2**, which determines this. Or more general, again it is the **dependencies from other rules which determine the values of wildcards**.

## Using the expand function instead

In the example above we explicitely defined each of the three input files, where the only difference is the value for wildcard **{wc1}**.
